I paid for it left saw the message was still on the screen so I went back showed the woman who called a mechanic out who said they would have to do a diagnostic but it was probably a cooling valve. I said then I wanted it fixed. She said they would do a diagnostic and let me know I said I had purchased the extended warranty and she said I will have to check.

Besides the loss of the tire, there was significant damage to the panels surrounding the wheel well.  USAA send funds to you after appraisal on 6/14. Ryan immediately ordered needed parts to repair as well as 4 new tires to upgrade (only 23k miles on the original tires). Advised that parts typically would arrive from Jacksonville within a day.  Was advised that they would be sent out to be painted, approx 3 days required to let the paint dry. Ryan rented me a car so I could travel home and avoid additional nights in Leesburg’ Holiday Inn. 6/21 tried to get an update/ status … no solid info yet.  Tried again 6/22 Ryan not spoke to Rhonda who had a busy morning but Promised to call me back before she went home.  Never happened. Subsequent calls early the following week were unsuccessful.  One call lasted 15 plus minutes and was handed off four times trying get me an update… lots of “hold time “. Other times I was routed to other departments and was greeted by surprised team members.  Everyone was polite but ineffective. July 4th week came and received news that some of the painting had not been completed.  Just finding this out the third week after getting the go ahead!   Spoke to Ryan and noting that the 4th was a holiday we aimed for possibly Sat. the 6th and agreed to confirm Friday the 5th so I didn’t make the 250 mile trip  for no good reason.  No go for Saturday, but Monday looked good , rather than count on it and be disappointed we decided to confirm a pickup by phone on Monday for Tuesday.   We arrived Tuesday approx 1045, and found that the shop was still working on it.  After touring your showroom for long enough to thoroughly examine all of your floor models we finally departed after midday. The work had not been completed nor the car cleaned at all ( after $1000s of repair dollars as well as $1300 worth of new tires I at a minimum would have expected a quick rinse).   I am grateful that your service group waived the rental fee, but feel they bore the brunt of a lack of interest and attention from the repair shop.  Clearly,  there are some communication issues as well as some weaknesses in your phone management system.   Thanks to Ryan for being patient with me and for putting up with the lack of support from the shop. Respectfully, John de Brun\n",

I was never apprised of the results, and I was expecting to hear some comments on my tire age and need for replacement as well.  The 15 point inspection was supposedly done, but no information was delivered. The biggest shock came when I received my bill, stating that I had requested a 'battery change', and that my existing battery was bad, and that I had authorized the replacement.  No one said anything to me at all regarding this issue, just presented the statement. I purchased a life time battery from Phillips a while back, but a service charge was added today for what they said was a bad battery.  Is it a poor policy to do work without a customer's approval!? I think so, and it angered me to think they did any additional service work without discussing it with me first.  I've been a loyal and dedicated customer of your firm in the past, but it seems like there has been an abbreviation in the information you now dispence about a customer's vehicle.

For example the paperwork said all the fluids were fine….its been almost 5k and window washing done from the car reservoir and yet no fluid at all was needed?

I walk with a cane and had to go into the building demanding the Service Manager. Demanding to be helped. They all stood around like useless lumps on a log. The only person that finally came to my aid was the Service Foreman Cody. I handed him my keys and said you drive this Vehicle  and tell me if it is safe. Needless to say, he drove the Vehicle  in the parking lot and Wholeheartedly agreed with me saying \"You are completely Correct\" How in the World can a Vehicle leave the Service area, get parked, keys given back to the customer  and tell the customer  to have a good night in a Vehicle that is not driveable?

When I brought it to the attention of the cashier she called for a manager who was quite pleasant and explained everything to me.

I was never apprised of the results, and I was expecting to hear some comments on my tire age and need for replacement as well.

The biggest shock came when I received my bill, stating that I had requested a 'battery change', and that my existing battery was bad, and that I had authorized the replacement.  No one said anything to me at all regarding this issue, just presented the statement. I purchased a life time battery from Phillips a while back, but a service charge was added today for what they said was a bad battery.  Is it a poor policy to do work without a customer's approval!? I think so, and it angered me to think they did any additional service work without discussing it with me first.  I've been a loyal and dedicated customer of your firm in the past, but it seems like there has been an abbreviation in the information you now dispence about a customer's vehicle.  These comments are not rendered in criticism, but only as an aid to possibly restore the former level of service that I received in the past                      Sincerely,                      Patricia Simmons\n",

I headed up there, drove 20 mins and got my oil and filter changed. When I was going to pay, they billed me for $80! I told them that I called in ask how much would it cost and it was $39.99.

I paid for it left saw the message was still on the screen so I went back showed the woman who called a mechanic out who said they would have to do a diagnostic but it was probably a cooling valve. I said then I wanted it fixed. She said they would do a diagnostic and let me know I said I had purchased the extended warranty and she said I will have to check.

Besides the loss of the tire, there was significant damage to the panels surrounding the wheel well.  USAA send funds to you after appraisal on 6/14. Ryan immediately ordered needed parts to repair as well as 4 new tires to upgrade (only 23k miles on the original tires). Advised that parts typically would arrive from Jacksonville within a day.  Was advised that they would be sent out to be painted, approx 3 days required to let the paint dry. Ryan rented me a car so I could travel home and avoid additional nights in Leesburg’ Holiday Inn. 6/21 tried to get an update/ status … no solid info yet.  Tried again 6/22 Ryan not spoke to Rhonda who had a busy morning but Promised to call me back before she went home.  Never happened. Subsequent calls early the following week were unsuccessful.  One call lasted 15 plus minutes and was handed off four times trying get me an update… lots of “hold time “. Other times I was routed to other departments and was greeted by surprised team members.  Everyone was polite but ineffective. July 4th week came and received news that some of the painting had not been completed.  Just finding this out the third week after getting the go ahead!   Spoke to Ryan and noting that the 4th was a holiday we aimed for possibly Sat. the 6th and agreed to confirm Friday the 5th so I didn’t make the 250 mile trip  for no good reason.  No go for Saturday, but Monday looked good , rather than count on it and be disappointed we decided to confirm a pickup by phone on Monday for Tuesday.   We arrived Tuesday approx 1045, and found that the shop was still working on it.  After touring your showroom for long enough to thoroughly examine all of your floor models we finally departed after midday. The work had not been completed nor the car cleaned at all ( after $1000s of repair dollars as well as $1300 worth of new tires I at a minimum would have expected a quick rinse).   I am grateful that your service group waived the rental fee, but feel they bore the brunt of a lack of interest and attention from the repair shop.  Clearly,  there are some communication issues as well as some weaknesses in your phone management system.   Thanks to Ryan for being patient with me and for putting up with the lack of support from the shop. Respectfully, John de Brun\n",

Formerly I was informed as to the condition of my car, tires, brakes, etc. Today I visited for an oil and filter change, AC. service and cabin filter replacement.  I was never apprised of the results, and I was expecting to hear some comments on my tire age and need for replacement as well.  The 15 point inspection was supposedly done, but no information was delivered. The biggest shock came when I received my bill, stating that I had requested a 'battery change', and that my existing battery was bad, and that I had authorized the replacement.  No one said anything to me at all regarding this issue, just presented the statement. I purchased a life time battery from Phillips a while back, but a service charge was added today for what they said was a bad battery.  Is it a poor policy to do work without a customer's approval!? I think so, and it angered me to think they did any additional service work without discussing it with me first.  I've been a loyal and dedicated customer of your firm in the past, but it seems like there has been an abbreviation in the information you now dispence about a customer's vehicle.  These comments are not rendered in criticism, but only as an aid to possibly restore the former level of service that I received in the past                      Sincerely,                      Patricia Simmons\n",

That might have been all it needed and I’m not complaining (4 stars is not bad after all).  It was just weird.  For example the paperwork said all the fluids were fine….its been almost 5k and window washing done from the car reservoir and yet no fluid at all was needed?  That’s what it says so it was just weird.  Maybe I haven’t used as much washer fluid as I thought but like I stated it just seemed weird.

I walk with a cane and had to go into the building demanding the Service Manager. Demanding to be helped. They all stood around like useless lumps on a log. The only person that finally came to my aid was the Service Foreman Cody. I handed him my keys and said you drive this Vehicle  and tell me if it is safe. Needless to say, he drove the Vehicle  in the parking lot and Wholeheartedly agreed with me saying \"You are completely Correct\" How in the World can a Vehicle leave the Service area, get parked, keys given back to the customer  and tell the customer  to have a good night in a Vehicle that is not driveable?

When I brought it to the attention of the cashier she called for a manager who was quite pleasant and explained everything to me.

Free weight section needs to move to another section of the gym. At a minimum, caution tape need to be put on the ground and management/staff needs to do a better job of policing the area immediately in front of the mirror so that folks are not crowding the rack or blocking other people from being able to move. I have personally seen fights break out simply because folks are bumping into each other.  Also, only 2 machines for leg extensions is just sad. Would love to see the turf area upstairs repurposed, such a large area with such a small volume of usage. Would be better off as another free weights section or double the amount of leg machines.

Also, staff allows people to hoard gym equipment with bags and water bottles, holding up multiple stations while talking on the phone, or to other people, without even working out. This happens every time I go to this gym.  I wish staff would actually tell people that they cannot use more than one machine at a time and don’t allow gym bags on the floor. I tripped over a gym bag today, and I hope that no one is seriously injured in the future.  A simple sign at check in and enforcement by staff would help both hoarding and liability issues.

The crowd here is disappointing and not serious about working out more so influencing with baby weights. The old LB gym on pine was 10x better than this. It represented what golds really stands for and this is trying to be bougie with cheap membership pricing just to make a quick buck but attracting a terrible crowd.

At a minimum, caution tape need to be put on the ground and management/staff needs to do a better job of policing the area immediately in front of the mirror so that folks are not crowding the rack or blocking other people from being able to move. I have personally seen fights break out simply because folks are bumping into each other.  Also, only 2 machines for leg extensions is just sad. Would love to see the turf area upstairs repurposed, such a large area with such a small volume of usage. Would be better off as another free weights section or double the amount of leg machines.

The crowd here is disappointing and not serious about working out more so influencing with baby weights. The old LB gym on pine was 10x better than this. It represented what golds really stands for and this is trying to be bougie with cheap membership pricing just to make a quick buck but attracting a terrible crowd. No wonder why people are leaving this gym to pay $100+ to be at a better environment with people who actually want to lift weights and not talk by a machine for an hour.

I stayed because I had committed to myself prior to entering the gym.  Making people feel comfortable and at ease would greatly improve the ability to keep them and to get them to commit- most people are already insecure about themselves while they’re looking at all the super fit  people -improve the bedside manner.

I paid for it left saw the message was still on the screen so I went back showed the woman who called a mechanic out who said they would have to do a diagnostic but it was probably a cooling valve. I said then I wanted it fixed. She said they would do a diagnostic and let me know I said I had purchased the extended warranty and she said I will have to check.

Besides the loss of the tire, there was significant damage to the panels surrounding the wheel well.  USAA send funds to you after appraisal on 6/14. Ryan immediately ordered needed parts to repair as well as 4 new tires to upgrade (only 23k miles on the original tires). Advised that parts typically would arrive from Jacksonville within a day.  Was advised that they would be sent out to be painted, approx 3 days required to let the paint dry. Ryan rented me a car so I could travel home and avoid additional nights in Leesburg’ Holiday Inn. 6/21 tried to get an update/ status … no solid info yet.  Tried again 6/22 Ryan not spoke to Rhonda who had a busy morning but Promised to call me back before she went home.  Never happened. Subsequent calls early the following week were unsuccessful.  One call lasted 15 plus minutes and was handed off four times trying get me an update… lots of “hold time “. Other times I was routed to other departments and was greeted by surprised team members.  Everyone was polite but ineffective. July 4th week came and received news that some of the painting had not been completed.  Just finding this out the third week after getting the go ahead!   Spoke to Ryan and noting that the 4th was a holiday we aimed for possibly Sat. the 6th and agreed to confirm Friday the 5th so I didn’t make the 250 mile trip  for no good reason.  No go for Saturday, but Monday looked good , rather than count on it and be disappointed we decided to confirm a pickup by phone on Monday for Tuesday.   We arrived Tuesday approx 1045, and found that the shop was still working on it.  After touring your showroom for long enough to thoroughly examine all of your floor models we finally departed after midday. The work had not been completed nor the car cleaned at all ( after $1000s of repair dollars as well as $1300 worth of new tires I at a minimum would have expected a quick rinse).   I am grateful that your service group waived the rental fee, but feel they bore the brunt of a lack of interest and attention from the repair shop.  Clearly,  there are some communication issues as well as some weaknesses in your phone management system.   Thanks to Ryan for being patient with me and for putting up with the lack of support from the shop. Respectfully, John de Brun\n",

Formerly I was informed as to the condition of my car, tires, brakes, etc. Today I visited for an oil and filter change, AC. service and cabin filter replacement.  I was never apprised of the results, and I was expecting to hear some comments on my tire age and need for replacement as well.  The 15 point inspection was supposedly done, but no information was delivered. The biggest shock came when I received my bill, stating that I had requested a 'battery change', and that my existing battery was bad, and that I had authorized the replacement.  No one said anything to me at all regarding this issue, just presented the statement. I purchased a life time battery from Phillips a while back, but a service charge was added today for what they said was a bad battery.  Is it a poor policy to do work without a customer's approval!? I think so, and it angered me to think they did any additional service work without discussing it with me first.

That might have been all it needed and I’m not complaining (4 stars is not bad after all).  It was just weird.  For example the paperwork said all the fluids were fine….its been almost 5k and window washing done from the car reservoir and yet no fluid at all was needed?  That’s what it says so it was just weird.  Maybe I haven’t used as much washer fluid as I thought but like I stated it just seemed weird.

Went to another dealership today and got brake service for less than 1/2 what I was quoted at Phillips.

I immediately returned  the Vehicle  stating it was unrivaled almost causing a wreck. My concerns and fears of driving the Vehicle fell on deaf ears. It was near closing time and everyone was more concerned  with going home instead of dealing with my problem. I sat in the Vehicle for  an extended  period of time, until I couldn't sit any longer. I walk with a cane and had to go into the building demanding the Service Manager. Demanding to be helped. They all stood around like useless lumps on a log. The only person that finally came to my aid was the Service Foreman Cody. I handed him my keys and said you drive this Vehicle  and tell me if it is safe. Needless to say, he drove the Vehicle  in the parking lot and Wholeheartedly agreed with me saying \"You are completely Correct\" How in the World can a Vehicle leave the Service area, get parked, keys given back to the customer  and tell the customer  to have a good night in a Vehicle that is not driveable?

I okayed that and when I went to pay the bill was $71. I was never told about the fee for service (disposal). When I brought it to the attention of the cashier she called for a manager who was quite pleasant and explained everything to me. I simply told him that all fees should be included in the initial quote. He was very accommodating and told me of the new procedure with service advisors.
